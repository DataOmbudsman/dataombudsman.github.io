During my time at Balabit (now One Identity), I worked on a biometric authentication algorithm to detect unauthorized usage in remote desktop sessions based on mouse movement data. We collected extensive data for model development and later released a portion of it publicly as part of a data science contest. I was responsible for defining the task (training/test sets, evaluation metrics) and publishing the data. This became the [Balabit Mouse Dynamics Challenge dataset](https://github.com/balabit/Mouse-Dynamics-Challenge), which has gained attention in the security research community and has been cited frequently, according to [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5217572375483788066&hl=en).
