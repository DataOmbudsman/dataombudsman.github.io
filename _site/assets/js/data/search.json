    "content": "I’ve always found city and village names fascinating—they feel like they hold hidden meanings that regular words don’t. So I wanted to see if I could generate entirely new locality names that don’t exist but still sound authentic. To do this, I trained a character-based LSTM on all ~3,100 Hungarian locality names and wrapped it in a Streamlit app so others could experiment with it as well.It was a fun project to practice PyTorch, and one discovery was that undertrained networks generated far more entertaining names. My personal favorites are Tokonya and Balatonhalász. Check out the app here and its repo here."

    "content": "I authored incdbscan, the open source implementation of IncrementalDBSCAN clustering as a Python package, after facing a problem at work. At LogMeIn, we wanted to cluster chat messages and were wondering if the clustering could be easily updated with adding new messages or removing old ones. DBSCAN had been working well for our clustering needs, so we started looking for an incremental version. Although the authors of DBSCAN described an algorithm called IncrementalDBSCAN in a 1998 paper, no public implementation seemed to exist.incdbscan became my COVID project. Implementing the algorithm turned out to be longer and more challenging than expected. The paper had a few gaps that forced me to rethink parts of the algorithm, handle tricky edge cases, and thoroughly test the implementation with unit tests. It was also a great chance to dive into tools and processes like line profiling, publishing to PyPI, and setting up pipelines with GitHub Actions.As of December 2024, incdbscan has grown in popularity, with about 1,500 monthly downloads according to PyPI Stats.You can find the code and usage examples here: https://github.com/DataOmbudsman/incdbscanThis work was also presented at the Budapest ML Forum and at a PyData Budapest meetup."

    "content": "During my time at Balabit (now One Identity), I worked on a biometric authentication algorithm to detect unauthorized usage in remote desktop sessions based on mouse movement data. We collected extensive data for model development and later released a portion of it publicly as part of a data science contest. I was responsible for defining the task (training/test sets, evaluation metrics) and publishing the data. This became the Balabit Mouse Dynamics Challenge dataset, which has gained attention in the security research community and has been cited frequently, according to Google Scholar."

    "content": "At Balabit (now One Identity), the data science team I was part of worked on unsupervised anomaly detection methods. We quickly noticed that performance evaluation—an essential aspect of any ML project—was far less standardized in this area compared to supervised learning, with fewer practical resources available. To address this, I documented our experiences and the solutions we developed in a series of blog posts. The posts resonated with others facing similar challenges, leading to follow-up feedback and questions. I’m also pleased to have introduced a metric I designed (Part 3) and shared a unique aspect of ROC-AUC (Part 4) that I haven’t seen discussed elsewhere.Here you can read the series:  How to Evaluate Unsupervised Anomaly Detection for User Behavior Analytics  Performance Metrics for Anomaly Detection Algorithms in Security Analytics  Novel Performance Metrics for Anomaly Detection Algorithms  A New Look at an Old Friend - How to visualize and generalize ROC-AUC"
